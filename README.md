GDG-X Boomerang for App Engine (Java)
==============================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Splaktar/boomerang-gae](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Splaktar/boomerang-gae?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is forked from the [GDG-X boomerang](https://github.com/gdg-x/boomerang) project.

Boomerang is a template for a dynamic material design GDG chapter web site that can be deployed
within 30 minutes. It pulls data from [GDG-X Hub](https://github.com/gdg-x/hub) and 
[Google+ API](https://developers.google.com/+/api/) using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and 
[Angular-Material](https://material.angularjs.org).

Prerequisites
---------------
* Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).
* GAE requires Java 7. Configure your IDE to use Java 7 for the project.
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)

On IntelliJ:
---------------
* Setup your local App Engine Dev Server in Preferences->Build, Execution, Deployment->Application Servers.
* Define the path to your App Engine SDK.
* Add the following directories to the libraries list of your new Application Server:
* google-cloud-sdk/platform/appengine-java-sdk/lib
* google-cloud-sdk/platform/appengine-java-sdk/lib/agent
* google-cloud-sdk/platform/appengine-java-sdk/lib/opt/user/appengine-endpoints/v1
* google-cloud-sdk/platform/appengine-java-sdk/lib/opt/user/datanucleus/v2
* google-cloud-sdk/platform/appengine-java-sdk/lib/shared
* google-cloud-sdk/platform/appengine-java-sdk/lib/user
* google-cloud-sdk/platform/appengine-java-sdk/lib/user/orm

Configuring
---------------
Update war/app/services/configService.js with values appropriate for your group:

1. **name**: The name of your GDG
2. **id**: The ID of the Google+ page for your GDG; for example, if your page
   URL is https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/115803993493374365281/, then the ID is '115803993493374365281'.
3. **google_api**: The API key for your project, available from the [Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/console)
  1. Create a new project then go to APIs & Auth->APIs, activate Google+ API.
  2. Go to APIs & Auth->Credentials and under Public API access 'Create new Key' of BrowserKey with `Any referrer allowed`.
4. **pwa_id**: The ID for a Picasa web album from which pictures will be drawn. If you do not have a Picasa web album
   for your group, you will want to comment out the photos tab in **index.html**.
5. **twitter**, **facebook**, **meetup**: Update these with your chapter's social network handles. Setting them to '' will hide the icon.
6. Create your Google Analytics account and modify the Google Analytics tracking code in **index.html**.
7. Open **war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml** and put your Project ID (available from Project Overview page of Cloud Console) in the `<application></application>` tag.

Additional Optional Config
---------------
5. **domain**: Your custom domain name (or base appspot URL).
6. **cover.title**: An announcement that will appear on the landing page.
7. **cover.subtitle**: More text to support the landing page announcement.
8. **cover.button.text**: Text for the announcement button.
9. **cover.button.url**: The URL that the announcement button will open in another window.
10. **cover.url**: If the cover image drawn from your Google+ page does not work with the default layout,
   you can specify a URL for a specific image instead.
12. Edit the snippet details in the **index.html** to change how your page looks when it is shared.
13. Modify the images in war/app/images/sponsor1 and war/app/images/sponsor2 to be your sponsor images.
14. Modify the sponsor links in **about.html**.
16. Create a free https://prerender.io account (up to 250 pages).
17. Find your token on prerender.io, insert it into **web.xml** where it says `INSERT_YOUR_PRERENDER_TOKEN_HERE`.
18. Update the war/sitemap.xml with the URL of your site.

NOTE: You cannot test prerendering of pages locally.

Building
---------------
Here you will install dependencies and tooling, build, minify, run static analysis, and more.

You must have Node.js installed to use the build tools. Download it [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).

From the boomerang directory, run the following:

1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `gulp prod`

NOTE: You may need to use `sudo` for running `npm` on OS X or Linux.

NOTE: For easier debugging and development use, use `gulp dev` but make sure to run `gulp prod` before deploying to production.

Deploy locally
---------------
Make sure you cd into the boomerang-gae directory, then: `dev_appserver.sh war`

On Windows: `dev_appserver.cmd war`

Testing
---------------
1. Unit tests can be run once via `gulp karma` or constantly via `gulp karma-watch`.
2. Integration tests can be run via:
  1. `node node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update`
  2. `node node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager start`
  3. Then in a separate terminal: `node node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor test/e2e/conf.js`
3. WebStorm or IntelliJ IDEA can make this testing a lot easier if you configure the idea to do it for you.

Deploy to App Engine via the CLI
---------------
Make sure you cd into the boomerang-gae directory, then: `sudo appcfg.sh --oauth2 update war`

On Windows: `appcfg.cmd --oauth2 update war`

If you see an exception about creds, run `gcloud auth login` and go through the OAuth flow with the proper account.
This always needs to be done at least the first time.

Development Details
---------------
Make sure that you do the following successfully before committing:

1. `gulp prod` - Make sure you fix any JSCS or JSHint errors.
2. `gulp karma` - Make sure that you fix any broken tests.
3. Protractor tests - Make sure that you fix any broken tests.
4. If you changed any dependency versions in `bower.json`, make sure that `config/CDN.json` is updated to match.
